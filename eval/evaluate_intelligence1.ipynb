      "TEST CASE 10:  A group of traders is planning a journey to a distant market. What advice should the sage provide to ensure their success?\n",
      "EXPECTED:  The sage should advise on the importance of preparation, including gathering information about the market and its customs. They might also suggest forming alliances with other traders and ensuring they have the necessary supplies for the journey.\n",
      "RESPONSE 1:  Ah, young traders, heed my wisdom before embarking on this perilous journey to the distant market. Firstly, pack lightly; excess baggage is a burden, not a blessing. Secondly, diversify your goods - don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n",
      "SCORE 1: 8\n",
      "REASONING 1: The AI's response is engaging and fits the theme of a sage providing advice. The advice to pack lightly is practical for a journey, and diversifying goods is sound advice for traders. However, the response could be more comprehensive by including suggestions about learning about the market, forming alliances, or ensuring proper supplies, which would align more closely with the given example response. Overall, the response is effective and socially engaging but lacks a bit of depth in terms of preparation specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESPONSE 2:  \"Hear my words, wise traders, for I shall impart valuable wisdom before thou embark on thy journey. Remember, profit is not measured solely by silver coins, but also by the wisdom gained and friendship forged along the way.\"\n",
      "SCORE 2: 7\n",
      "REASONING 2: The AI model's response is creative and aligns well with the character of a sage offering wisdom. It imparts a broader view of success beyond just monetary gain, emphasizing wisdom and friendship. While it captures the essence of a sage-like advice, it lacks specific practical advice related to preparation, market customs, or logistics which would be crucial for a trader's journey. Thus, it provides a valuable perspective but could be improved with more concrete guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "RESPONSE 3:  \"Listen close, noble traders, for I shall impart to you wisdom gathered from the sands of time's vast desert. Your journey's success depends not merely on the quality of your goods or the strength of your camels, but on three precious virtues: *Forethought, Patience, and Trust*.\"\n",
      "SCORE 3: 8\n",
      "REASONING 3: The AI model provides a response that is both engaging and relevant to the question, offering advice that is metaphorical yet applicable to the traders' journey. The mention of 'Forethought, Patience, and Trust' aligns well with the core elements of a successful trading expedition. However, it lacks specific practical advice such as market research, supply management, or alliance-building which would provide more tangible guidance. Nevertheless, the response fits well within the context of a sage imparting wisdom, emphasizing virtues that are crucial for success. The model's strength in social interaction is evident in the poetic delivery, making the advice memorable and impactful.\n",
